# Project Plan: Hybrid Neural ODE-CNN Model for Efficient Image Classification

## 1. Project Overview
Develop a hybrid model that combines Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. The goal is to create a more efficient and accurate model that leverages the continuous nature of ODEs and the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs.

## 2. Objectives
- Design a hybrid architecture that integrates Neural ODE layers with CNN layers
- Implement the hybrid model for image classification tasks
- Compare the performance, memory efficiency, and training time of the hybrid model against traditional CNNs and pure Neural ODE models
- Analyze the impact of the continuous ODE layers on model generalization and robustness

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Model Architecture
- Design a hybrid architecture with the following components:
  - Initial CNN layers for feature extraction
  - Neural ODE layer(s) for continuous transformation of features
  - Final CNN layers and dense layers for classification

### 3.2 Implementation
- Use PyTorch for implementation due to its dynamic computational graph and existing Neural ODE libraries
- Implement the hybrid model using the `torchdiffeq` library for ODE solvers
- Develop custom layers that seamlessly integrate CNN and ODE components

### 3.3 Experimentation
- Dataset: Start with CIFAR-10 for initial testing and validation
- Training:
  - Implement adaptive learning rate strategies
  - Experiment with different ODE solvers (e.g., Runge-Kutta, adaptive step size methods)
- Evaluation:
  - Compare accuracy, training time, and memory usage against baseline CNN models
  - Analyze convergence behavior and training stability

### 3.4 Analysis
- Visualize learned features at different stages of the model
- Conduct ablation studies to understand the contribution of ODE layers
- Assess model robustness to input perturbations and dataset shifts

## 4. Timeline
- Week 1-2: Literature review and detailed architecture design
- Week 3-4: Implementation of the hybrid model
- Week 5-6: Training and initial experiments
- Week 7-8: Comparative analysis and ablation studies
- Week 9-10: Final evaluation, visualization, and report writing

## 5. Expected Outcomes
- A novel hybrid Neural ODE-CNN architecture for image classification
- Empirical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid approach
- Insights into the benefits of combining continuous and discrete learning methods in deep learning models

## 6. Future Extensions
